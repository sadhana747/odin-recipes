    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <li>4-5 medium-sized apples (choose a sweet variety)</li>
    <li>Cold water</li>
    <li>Ice cubes</li>
    <li>Optional: Mint leaves for garnish</li>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the Apples:
        <ul>
          <li>Wash the apples thoroughly under running water.</li>
          <li>
            If desired, peel the apples for a smoother texture, or you can leave
            the peel on for added nutrients and color.
          </li>
          <li>Core the apples and remove the seeds.</li>
          <li>
            Cut the apples into bite-sized pieces. The size can vary based on
            your preference, but aim for small chunks that are easy to blend.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Chill the Apple Pieces:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Place the bite-sized apple pieces in a bowl and refrigerate them for
            at least 30 minutes. Chilled apples will make the juice more
            refreshing.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend the Apple Juice:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Once the apple pieces are chilled, transfer them to a blender.
          </li>
          <li>Add a splash of cold water to help with blending.</li>
          <li>
            Blend on high speed until the apples are completely pureed and the
            juice is smooth.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the Juice (Optional):
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you prefer a smoother texture, strain the apple puree through a
            fine mesh strainer to remove any larger pieces or pulp. This step is
            optional and depends on your preference.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the Cold Apple Juice:
        <ul>
          <li>Fill glasses with ice cubes for an extra chilled experience.</li>
          <li>
            Pour the freshly blended or strained apple juice into the glasses.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish and Enjoy:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If desired, garnish the apple juice with a few mint leaves for a
            burst of freshness and aroma.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir the juice gently before drinking to ensure an even distribution
            of flavors.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve Immediately:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Apple juice is best enjoyed immediately while it's cold and at its
            freshest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sip and savor the deliciousness of your homemade cold and tasty
            apple juice with delightful bite-sized apple pieces!
