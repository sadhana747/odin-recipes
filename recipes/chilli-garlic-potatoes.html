      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, chili powder,

      <li>Place the coated potatoes on a baking sheet in a single layer.</li>
      <li>
        Roast the potatoes in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or
        until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside and tender on the
        inside. Make sure to stir the potatoes halfway through for even cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the potatoes are cooked, remove them from the oven and transfer
        them to a serving dish.
      </li>
